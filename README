This is an ongoing project written in C and compiled with the GNU
compiler. It's an infinite loop that plays around with the "ncurses"
library. I have to give credit to Dan Gookin who wrote the book 
"Programmers Guide to ncurses" published by Wiley. Dan has a web
page where you can download sample code. -ksand 10/5/14
